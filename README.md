# leaderboard

This project is a RESTful API Node.js leaderboards module designed for use in games and other projects.

This project is a continuation of my work at Nationwide Children's Hospital, converting a simple
MySQL leaderboard into a MVC driven API using Sequelize for modeling.

This conversion began 01/14/19.
